### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<br />
I love to talk to and know people, learn about almost everything, and teach. I'm a developer passionate about Java and have been programming with that language for more than ten years! I like ballroom dances, handcraft made beer and <a href="https://portaldoqueijo.com.br/gastronomia/harmonizacao/2017/05/15/sugestao-queijo-do-serro">cheeses from Minas Gerais</a>, and, as a good developer, I also use to transform coffee in code!

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a backend developer in [Zup Innovation](https://www.zup.com.br/en)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about cloud computing and containers
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Java systems.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java language and patterns, and good cheeses from Minas.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: curious, political, passionate.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I actually have a degree in automation engineering and I used to think I would work with airplanes, but IT is too much more fun!
